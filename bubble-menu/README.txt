== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't the buttons appear on my site? =
If the buttons aren't showing, it's usually caused by caching issues. To fix this, follow these steps:

1. **Clear browser cache** – Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac).
2. **Clear WordPress cache** – Purge cache in your caching plugin settings (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache).
3. **Clear hosting/server cache** – Purge cache via hosting control panel (Cloudflare, SiteGround, Nginx).
4. **Temporarily disable caching** – If the above steps don't help, deactivate caching plugins temporarily to confirm.

= Buttons appear only for administrators. How can I make them visible to everyone? =
Make sure **Test Mode** is turned off. When Test Mode is active, the buttons are visible only to site administrators and hidden from regular visitors.

= Can I customize button placement on my site? =
Yes! You can position the buttons to appear on the **left, right, top, or bottom** of your site from the plugin settings.

= Can I show buttons only on specific pages or posts? =
Yes. In the **Lite version**, you can:
- Display buttons **sitewide** (all pages).
- Manually insert buttons using the shortcode `[Bubble-Menu id="1"]` to place buttons only on specific pages or posts.

The **Pro version** provides advanced targeting options by categories, specific pages, post types, user roles, and more.

= Can I create multiple button sets on one page? =
Absolutely! You can create and use multiple sets of Bubble Menu buttons simultaneously, each with its own configuration and style.

= How do I use Bubble Menu on a multisite network? =
For multisite installations, **don't activate Bubble Menu network-wide**. Instead, activate it individually **on each site** where you plan to use it.

= Will Bubble Menu slow down my website? =
No. Bubble Menu is lightweight and optimized for maximum speed and performance, ensuring minimal impact on your site's loading time.
